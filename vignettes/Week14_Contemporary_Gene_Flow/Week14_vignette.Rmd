## 1. Overview

### a) Background and Goals

In this lab you will use the `gstudio` package to analyse parent-offspring data for the wildflower *Pulsatilla vulgaris*. You will learn how to conduct landscape genetic analyses on pollen pools, conduct paternity analysis to quantify contemporary pollen flow, and relate realized pollen flow events to landscape variables.

The data are from the paper "DiLeo et al. (in press) Contemporary pollen flow as a multiscale process: evidence from the insect-pollinated herb Pulsatilla vulgaris. Journal of Ecology". The data include genotypes from seeds, mothers, and all potential fathers from seven focal populations. The study area in the Franconian Jura in Germany is the same as for the *Dianthus carthusianorum* data from Week 7 (see introductory video by Yessica Rico for the Dianthus data set to learn more about the system). We will recreate one analysis from the paper, looking at the ecological factors that best explain pollen immigration rates of the seven populations. 

**NOTE HW: what are the genetic data? Microsats?**

### b) Data set

There are three data files associated with this lab: 

- "pulsatilla_genotypes.csv", which contains the genotypes of offspring, mothers, and potential fathers from seven populations,
- "pulsatilla_momVariables.csv", which contains ecological variables collect for each mother, and 
- "pulsatilla_population.csv", which contains landscape and population size information for each of the seven populations. 

### c) Required packages

To start load the required libraries. All packages should have been installed already with the package `LandGenCourse`.

**NOTE HW: Is popgraph needed? For what function?**
```{r}
library(LandGenCourse)
#library(devtools)
#install_github("dyerlab/popgraph")
#install_github("dyerlab/gstudio")
#library(gstudio)
#library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)
#library(purrr)
#library(MuMIn)
#library(lme4)
```

## 2. Import Genotypes

**NOTE HW: we could make the dataset available within 'LandGenCourse', e.g. as an 'ecogen' object or as a spaital points data frame?**

The package `gstudio` makes it very easy to import genotype data (see Week 1). Typically, we store our genotype data in a spreadsheet with one line per individual and two columns per locus. Using the `read_population()` function, we tell `gstudio` which columns contain our loci. The argument `type="column"` indicates that our raw text file stores genotypes in two columns per locus.

```{r}
dat <- gstudio::read_population("pulsatilla_genotypes.csv", 
                                type = "column", locus.columns = 6:19)
dat$ID <- as.factor(dat$ID)
```

Let's take a look at the data:

```{r}
head(dat)
```

There are 12 columns:

- **ID**: A unique identifier for every adult
- **OffID**: Zero if the sample is an adult and >0 if the sample is an offspring
- **Population**: The population of origin
- **2 coordinate columns, X & Y**: The geographic coordinates of the sample
- **7 locus columns**: For each locus, the genotype is stored in a single column with alleles separated by ":"*

**NOTE HW: What are the coordinates? Same as for Dianthus? Are they Euclidean, like UTM?**

Let's look at the data for mother with the ID=3083 and her associated offspring:

```{r}
dat[dat$ID == "3083",]
```

The first row is the mother and the subsequent rows are her offspring with OffIDs 1-8.

## 3. Pollen pool genetic structure

### a) Subtract maternal contribution to offspring genotype

Now, use the `minus_mom()` function to remove the mother's contribution to the offspring genotypes. You will be left with just the paternal contribution. The allele frequcies of all paternal contributions associated with a single mother is called a "pollen pool".

**NOTE HW: Can  you show what happens if mother and offspring both are heterozygous with the same two alleles?**

```{r}
pollen <- gstudio::minus_mom(dat, MomCol = "ID", OffCol = "OffID")
pollen[pollen$ID == "3083",]
```

Now the pollen pool data can be analysed as any other population genetic data. You can ignore the warning - it just means that there are some missing genotypes for some of the offspring.

### b) 'TwoGener' analysis (AMOVA of pollen pool data)

For example, we can conduct an AMOVA (see Week 4) to test if pollen pools belonging to different mothers are signficantly differentiated from one another. When an AMOVA is applied to pollen pools it is called a 'TwoGener' analysis (Two-generational analysis; Smouse et al. 2001, Dyer et al. 2004). Here we use the `adonis()` function from the `vegan` pacakage to do the analysis of variance on genetic distance matrices (AMOVA).

```{r}
D <- gstudio::genetic_distance(pollen,mode="amova")
D <- as.dist(D)
Moms <- pollen$ID
vegan::adonis(D ~ Moms)
```

From this output it can be seen that there is a signficant difference in pollen pools among mothers.

### c) Including space: Isolation by distance

The 'TwoGener' analysis gives a summary statistic describing overall differentiation, but this does not tell us anything about **why** the pollen pools are differentiated. In order to better understand **why**, we can analyse the data spatially just like any other landscape genetic dataset. For example, we can test a basic hypothesis of isolation by distance by asking: are pollen pools from mothers that are geographically close more similar than those that are far? We test this by calculating pairwise genetic similarity (proportion of shared alleles) and relate this to geographic distance.

```{r}
  # calculate matrix of pairwise genetic similarity among pollen pools
  dps <- gstudio::genetic_distance(pollen, stratum = "ID", mode = "Dps")

  # calculate matrix of pairwise geographic distance among pollen pools
  xy <- unique(data.frame(pollen$X, pollen$Y))
  xy.dist <- as.matrix(dist(xy))
  
  # plot
  plot(xy.dist[lower.tri(xy.dist)], dps[lower.tri(dps)], 
       xlab = "geographic distance (m)", ylab = "proportion of shared alleles (dps)")
  abline(lm(dps[lower.tri(dps)]~xy.dist[lower.tri(xy.dist)]))
```

We see a slight pattern of isolation-by-distance where pollen pools that are spatially close are more similar. 

## 4. Paternity analysis

TwoGener and related methods are sensitive to inbreeding and strong genetic structure of adult populations, although methods exist to correct for some of these things (e.g. Dyer et al. 2004, Heredity). However, it is often the best (or only) option for quantifying pollen flow for high density species where other analyses such as paternity assignment cannot be conducted. 

In our case, we have complete sampling of potential fathers within the seven populations from which mothers and their offspring were sampled. Therefore, we are able to conduct a paternity analysis, which will give us more detailed information about contemporary pollen flow. Note that we do not have complete sampling of all potential fathers within the larger study region, and so we assume that any seed that is not assigned to a father is a pollen immigration event. In this section, we will conduct a paternity analysis using the `gstudio` package and relate the results to landscape variables.

### a) Exclusion probabilities

First let's check if our genetic markers have sufficient information (genetic resolution) to discriminate among alternative fathers by calculating exclusion probabilites.

```{r}
# exclusion probabilities
pollen.freqs <- gstudio::frequencies(dat)
p.excl <- gstudio::exclusion_probability( pollen.freqs )
p.excl
```

The second column, 'Pexl', gives us the information we need. We can see that certain loci have poor ability to exclude alternative potential fathers (e.g. 'loc2') and others are much more informative (e.g. 'loc3'). Luckily, we have multiple loci to use and the multilocus exclusion probability can be calculated by multiplying across loci.

The code below does the following:

- `1 - unlist(p.excl$Pexcl)`: extract the elements of `p.excl.Pexcl` (the exclusion probabilities for all loci) as a vector and calculage for each locus, the complement of the exclusion probability.  
- `1 - prod()`: multiplies the probabilities, and take the complement to get the multilocus exculsion probability.

```{r}
1- prod((1-unlist(p.excl$Pexcl)))
```

We see that using all seven loci, we acheive avery high exlusion probability, and that on average we should be able to exclude 99.9 of alternative fathers.

### b) Paternity analysis

We will use the `gstudio` function `paternity`, which conducts a fractional allocation paternity analyis. This approach is useful when full exclusion cannot be acheived. In case multiple potential fathers cannot be exluded for a particular offspring, a likelihood of paternity is calculated for each non-excluded father based on Mendelian transition probabilites. Note that in the original paper from which these data originate, we used a more sophisticated approach implemented in the program 'COLONY2'. 'COLONY2' can account for genotyping errors, whereas the `gstudio` function `paternity` approach cannot and so we had to throw out some of our data here.

Now let's conduct a paternity analysis for the seeds from mother 3083:


```{r}
# Select all offspring of mom 3083:
offspring.3083 <- subset(dat, OffID!=0 & ID == "3083")
# Select mom 3083:
mother.3083 <- subset(dat, ID == "3083" & dat$OffID == 0 )
# Select all potential fathers in the same population as mom 3083:
fathers.3083 <- subset(dat, OffID == 0 & Population %in% offspring.3083$Population)
# Paternity analysis: 
pat.3083 <- gstudio::paternity(offspring.3083, mother.3083, fathers.3083 )
pat.3083
```

We see that not all fathers could be excluded for some of the offspring.

Now let's do the paternity for the entire data set. First, we define a function `get.parentage` that does the paternity analysis for the offspring of one mome (i.e., one family). 

```{r}
# make a dataframe just for the offspring:
offspring <- subset(dat, OffID!=0)

# here is the function that we will apply to all mothers:
get.parentage <- function(x){
  tmp.offspring <- subset(offspring, ID == x)
  tmp.mother <- subset(dat, ID == x & OffID == 0)
  tmp.fathers <- subset(dat, OffID == 0 & Population %in% tmp.offspring$Population)
  return(gstudio::paternity(tmp.offspring, tmp.mother, tmp.fathers ))
}
```

We could use `lapply` to apply `get.parentage` to each mom and her offspring. Here, we use an alternative function `map` from package `purr` (which is part of the new 'tidyverse' set of packages by Hadley Wickham). This allows us to address the following issue: Because we have not sampled all potential fathers in the larger study region, `paternity` will return an error when all offspring of a certain mother cannot be assigned to any father. To get around this, we will use the `possibly` function from the library `purrr`. When an error occurs, it will simply return `NA` instead of stopping our function.  The function `map` knows how to apply a 'purrr-ified' function to an object.

This will take about a minute to run:

```{r}
# purrr-ify the function so that NA is returned when an error pops up:
possible_pat <- purrr::possibly(get.parentage, otherwise = NA_real_)

# run the function and store the output:
# list of results for each mother:
pat.all <- purrr::map(unique(offspring$ID), possible_pat)
# convert the list to a dataframe:
pat.all <- do.call(rbind, pat.all[!is.na(pat.all)]) 
```

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will keep only the highest-probability father for each offspring. With your own data, you should choose some sort of threshold (e.g. keep only those with probability > 0.9) or you can conduct analyses using the probability as weights.

```{r}
# create a temporary ID that combines the MomID and the OffID
pat.all$tmpID <- paste(pat.all$MomID, pat.all$OffID, sep="_")
# get rid of all rows with duplicated tmpIDs, leaving just the first entry for each
pat.sub <- pat.all[!duplicated(pat.all$tmpID),]
# get rid of the tmpID column
pat.sub <- pat.sub[,1:4] # get rid of the tmp_ID column

```

### c) Visualize reconstructed pollen flow events in space

We can use the `spider_plot` function from `gstudio` to visualize the paternity assignments. `spiderplot` takes the output from `paternity` and combines it with spatial XY coordinate information. The output includes the coordinates of both mother (X, Y) and father (Xend, Yend) for each offspring. Here we will also add in the population IDs so that we can visualize each of the seven populations separately.

**NOTE HW: does this assume that coordinates are in latlon format/projection?**

```{r}
pat.sub <- gstudio::spiderplot_data(pat.sub, dat, longitude = "X", latitude = "Y")
# Join data to add population IDs
pat.sub <- merge(pat.sub, dat[, c("Population", "ID" ,"OffID")],
                 by.x=c("MomID", "OffID"), by.y=c("ID", "OffID"), all.x=T)

head(pat.sub)
```

Use `ggplot2` to visualize the reconstructed pollen flow events. Let's look at population 'A25' first. The arrows point to mothers, and arrows without lines indicate selfing events. The darkness of the lines is proportional to the number of pollen flow events between a particular mother and father.

```{r}
pop <- "A25"
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=dat[dat$Population==pop,], aes(X,Y, size=3, color="red")) +
  geom_segment(data=pat.sub[pat.sub$Population==pop,], 
               aes(x=X, y=Y, xend=Xend, yend=Yend),
               size=1.5, alpha=0.2,
               arrow = arrow(ends = "first", length = unit(0.3, "cm"))) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

### d) Visualize dispersal kernel

We can calculate the distance of each pollen flow event, and then plot the distribution to visualize the dispersal kernel.

```{r}
# calculate distance for each event
pat.sub$pollen.dist <- unlist(lapply(1:nrow(pat.sub),
               function(x) dist(rbind(c(pat.sub$X[x], pat.sub$Y[x]),
                                      c(pat.sub$Xend[x], pat.sub$Yend[x]))) ))
# plot the distribution of pollination events that are greater than 0 m (i.e. excluding selfing)
ggplot(pat.sub[pat.sub$pollen.dist >0,]) +
  geom_histogram( aes(x=pollen.dist),  bins=20) +
  xlab("distance from pollen source (m)")  +
  ylab("# of pollen flow events")

```

## 5. Linking paternity to ecological variables

Now that we have conducted our paternity analysis, we can ask which ecological factors explain the patterns that we see. 

- First we will look within populations: what factors explain pollen flow distances within populations? 
- Second, we will look at the population level: what factors explain pollen immigration rates?

### a) Explain pollen flow within populations

We have collected some information about mothers, which we now add to the 'pat.sub' dataframe. Specifically, we have measured:

- **Mother isolation**: how far a mom is from other conspecifics, and 
- **Local floral density**: how many flowers are within 2 m of mother plants. 

We are only interested in outcrossed pollen events, so we make a new data frame that excludes selfing.

```{r}
# read in the data
mom.vars <- read.csv("pulsatilla_momVariables.csv")
# exclude selfing
pat.outcrossed <- subset(pat.sub, MomID != DadID)
# add mom variables to pat.outcrossed
pat.outcrossed <- merge(pat.outcrossed, mom.vars, by.x = "MomID", 
                        by.y = "ID", all.x=T)
# look at the data
head(pat.outcrossed)
```

Let's run some models to test if `mom.isolation` or `flower.density` explain pollen flow distances. We used mixed models with population and mother ID as random effects to control for multiple sampling from the same mom and populations (see Week 6 videos for linear mixed models).

```{r}
# specify the model
mod <- lme4::lmer(log(pollen.dist) ~ scale(log(flower.density)) + 
            scale(log(mom.isolation)) + (1|Population/MomID),
            data=pat.outcrossed, na.action = "na.fail", REML=F)
# model selection
MuMIn::dredge(mod)
```

We see that the best model includes both flower desnity and mom.isolation (see Week 12 for model selection). 

Let's plot the relationships:

```{r}
ggplot(pat.outcrossed, aes(x=log(mom.isolation), y=log(pollen.dist))) + geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method="lm", se=F) + 
  xlab("log(mom isolation)") +
  ylab("log(pollen flow distance)")
```

```{r}
ggplot(pat.outcrossed, aes(x=log(flower.density), y=log(pollen.dist))) + geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method="lm", se=F) + 
  xlab("log(flower density)") +
  ylab("log(pollen flow distance)")
```

It looks like moms that are more isolated and are surrounded by fewer flowers receive pollen from further away

### b) Explain pollen flow at the population level

Now let's look at the population level. First we need to calculate how many offspring were unable to be assigned a father. We do this by adding the first four columns of the paternity analysis output (which contains only successful assignments) to the offspring dataframe (which includes all offspring, regardless of assignment). If there is no assigment, 'Fij' will be NA in the newly merged data frame.

```{r}
offspring <- merge(offspring, pat.sub[,1:4], by.x=c("ID", "OffID"), 
                   by.y=c("MomID", "OffID"), all.x=T)
head(offspring)
```

Calculate the number of outside pollination events per population by counting the number of NAs in the 'Fij' column.

**NOTE HW: maybe use dplyr instead of tapply?**

```{r}
# number of outside pollination events per population: 
num.out <- tapply(offspring$Fij, offspring$Population, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
# total number of pollination events per population (should be same as the number of seeds sampled):
num.tot <- table(offspring$Population)
```

Let's put this information into a data frame and add ecological information that we have gathered about each population. Specifically we have measured the proportion of forested landscape at radii of 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 metres from population centroids, and have measured population size as the total number of flowering plants per population.

```{r}
# turn it into a dataframe:
pop.df <- data.frame(Population=names(num.out), num.out=as.vector(num.out), num.tot=as.vector(num.tot))
# read in the population variable data:
pop.vars <- read.csv("pulsatilla_population.csv")
# add the population variables to our outside pollination data:
pop.df <- merge(pop.df, pop.vars, by="Population")
pop.df
```

Now we can run a model to see which variables best explain the proportion of immigrated pollen per population. Because we only have n=7 populations, we limit the models to a single explanatory variable. We first scale the variables to make sure estimates are comparable. Our response variable is a proportion, so we use a glm with binomial error distribution.

```{r}
# scale the explanatory variables
pop.df[,4:9] <- scale(pop.df[,4:9])
# specify the model
mod2 <- glm(cbind(num.out, num.tot-num.out) ~ forest.50 + forest.100 +
              forest.250 + forest.500 + forest.1000 + population.size,
              family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = pop.df, 
              na.action = "na.fail")
# model selection, specifying that only a single predictor per model should be included
MuMIn::dredge(mod2,m.lim=c(0,1) )
```

We see that the best model is the null intercept model, suggesting that none of the predictors fit the data very well. However, the next best model includes 'forest.250' and with a delta AICc of less than 2, we take this model to be equally likely. 

Interestingly, in our original paper with found that forest.500 was the best predictor, followed by population size. This suggests that the choice of paternity analysis really can make a difference.

Let's plot the model including forest.250:

```{r}
forest.250.mod <- glm(cbind(num.out, num.tot-num.out) ~ forest.250,
                family=binomial(link="logit"), data=pop.df)

ggplot(pop.df, aes(x=forest.250, y=num.out/num.tot)) + geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(x=forest.250, y=predict(forest.250.mod, type="response"))) +
  xlab("proportion of forest at 250 m") +
  ylab("proportion of immigrant pollen")
```

We see that populations surrounded by more forest receive less outside pollen.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=TRUE, include=FALSE}
LandGenCourse::detachAllPackages()
```
